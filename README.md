# Nikahub Control Plane

Nikahub Control Plane is a customized solution built upon the foundation of [AWS SaaS Boost](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-saas-boost). It provides a production-ready control layer for deploying and managing **multi-tenant SaaS workloads** on AWS, tailored specifically for the needs of the Nikahub platform.

By leveraging and extending the AWS SaaS Boost architecture, this project simplifies the most time-consuming parts of SaaS platform engineering‚Äî**tenant onboarding, infrastructure provisioning, billing, metering, and operational insights**‚Äîallowing more focus on core product innovation.

## üí° Why Nikahub Control Plane?

I implemented this project to address the recurring challenges I encountered while building and operating cloud-based, multi-tenant SaaS platforms. This control plane embodies hands-on experience with:

- **Automated CI/CD** using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and related tooling  
- **Infrastructure as Code** with CloudFormation and Terraform  
- **Monitoring & Observability** via CloudWatch, X-Ray, and log-driven dashboards  
- **Flexible onboarding flows** to handle diverse tenant setups dynamically  

As a result, I've cut down tenant provisioning time from **days or hours to just minutes**, drastically improving development efficiency and platform scalability.
